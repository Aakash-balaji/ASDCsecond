        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>
        <p><b>what is the best time to travel in indai?</b></p>
        <p>The diverse topography of India comprises mountains, beaches, and deserts. The large size of the country also blesses it with different climatic conditions, which means that, while some places in India may have the mercury rising in the summers, there are some, where the weather is cool and pleasant. Therefore, the best time to travel to India depends on the places a tourist would like to visit in the country. However, it is also safe to say that the winter season (October - March) is mostly preferred by the tourists while visiting India</p>
        <p><b>what type of cloths should do i need to carry while traveling to india</b></p>
        <p>1. Season :Since India experiences hot summers (in most of the parts) and chilly winters, travellers should pack according to the month they are planning a visit in. If the trip is planned in the months between March and September, carrying light woolens (in the hills) and cotton clothes (in other areas) will be enough. On the other hand, if the trip is scheduled between October and February, carrying heavy woollens for North India and light woollens for South India is advisable</p>
        <p>2. Special Interest Tour :If you have booked your tour for trekking in India or wildlife safari or any other specific activity, then the clothing has to be carried accordingly. For wildlife safari, camouflage clothing, or clothes of green and brown shades are recommended. For trekking, clothing varies according to the place, altitude, season and difficulty grade. Though carrying clothes for layering; a down jacket; a good pair or trekking shoes; a sun hat; a woollen cap, muffler; socks; and a pair of gloves are required.</p>
