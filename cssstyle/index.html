       <p>Artificial intelligence (AI): is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of humans or animals. It is also the field of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines. "AI" may also refer to the machines themselves.</p>

        <b>Reasoning, problem-solving</b>
        <p>Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.[10] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.[11]

        Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a "combinatorial explosion": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.[12] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[13] Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.

        <b>Applications</b>
        <p>
            AI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search), targeting online advertisements,[122] recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon), driving internet traffic,[123][124] targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa),[125] autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars), automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate), facial recognition (Apple's Face ID or Microsoft's DeepFace) and image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple's iPhoto and TikTok).

        There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported they had incorporated "AI" in some offerings or processes.[126] A few examples are energy storage,[127] medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions,[128] foreign policy,[129] or supply chain management.

        Game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques. Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.[130] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.[131] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps.[132] Then it defeated Ke Jie in 2017, who at the time continuously held the world No. 1 ranking for two years.[133][134][135] Other programs handle imperfect-information games; such as for poker at a superhuman level, Pluribus[l] and Cepheus.[137] DeepMind in the 2010s developed a "generalized artificial intelligence" that could learn many diverse Atari games on its own.
